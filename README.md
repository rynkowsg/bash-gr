A collection of common utilities that I use in my shell scripts,
all rounded up thanks to [sosh](https://github.com/rynkowsg/sosh).

Just a heads-up, this is mostly for my own use, so things might shift around a bit.
**Use at your own risk**.

## Motivation

I just needed a spot to keep all the bits and pieces I use in different projects,
so I wasn't always copy-pasting or even reinventing the wheel.
This repo is my fix for that.
